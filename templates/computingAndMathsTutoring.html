            Benefits of one-to-one tuition:

        <div class="paragraphContent">
          One-to-one tuition has massive benefits when compared to group lessons. All the focus will be on the one person meaning that the lessons can be completely personalised to them.
          <br/><br/>
          Also, the ability to connect with one pupil is much easier than with a group, and as I will be in a similar age group, I should be able to relate to them easier than an older teacher can.
          This should benefit them greatly as they will be able to learn much more and have much more focused sessions tailored to them, so they will learn the most appropriate material.
